        <h3>Web Design of a Wall of Images for Pixar movies</h3> 
        <b><br>Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript</b><br>
        I designed a Wall of Images for Pixar movies using data stored in a pixar.json file.
        <br><br>
        Outcome: The website includes three filters to change the display of images based on the year of production, director, and order of display (ascending or descending). This provides an interactive and user-friendly experience for visitors.
